#ReflexGame

- This is my lastest Arduino project. I made it in about two days and it's also my longest (469 lines, nice). This sketch is a simple reflex game that you can build and upload to your Arduino Uno. You can play with your friend (2 players are required) and all you have to do is click the button as soon as a LED, or a buzzer, is triggered (you can choose your favorite mode). Also, you can see your updated score and leaderboard on the LCD display after every round. I think it's quite fun to play, so give it a try!
